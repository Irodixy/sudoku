# Sudoku

This is the first real contact with programming that I had at the beginning of my studies.
Here we used Portugol, a programming language derived from C, but entirely in Portuguese.
I used it to develop a fully functional Sudoku game, with randomised solutions and 3 types of challenges on top of that.
It was an amazing experience that made me fall in love with programming and showed me that only your imagination is the limit.
All the code you see here was developed by me, partly inspired by example projects the programme already had and even other code, especially one that allowed me to do what I later came to know as recursions. That was the most important part, to make sure that the code could solve the random puzzles every time a new game was requested.
